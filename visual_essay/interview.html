        <p class="title">
            What originally made you want to become an graphic designer?
        </p>
        <p class="para">I wasn’t really looking to become a graphic designer and in fact I wasn’t – until the ripe old age of 26! graphic design is a second career for me, I have a degree in sociology, and taught that for a few years, then somewhat by chance, I took
            a two-week summer workshop at the university of arizona – about this thing called ‘graphic design’. It changed everything. I hadn’t even known the term graphic design before then. A great instructor, and good friend to this day, jackson boelts
            – helped me take the first steps on this fantastic journey – one I could have never imagined.
            <br>
            <br> I feel I’m the most fortunate designer on the planet. as a result of this career choice, well passion really, I had no choice once I had discovered it! Over twenty five years later I’ve visited and lectured all over the world, had numerous
            exhibitions, books and received notable awards, and all because I found something I was passionate about, and pursued it, without ever looking back. I found something that never felt like work. I’ve always said I make my living from my hobby.
            <br>
            <br> Just this year I’ve received the AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) gold medal, and was named as one of apple’s 30 most innovative designers in their 30 year history – only 2 graphic designers were chosen, the other being april
            grieman. They called us ‘pioneers with profound impact’ – I’m really proud of that one.
            <br> The past few years have been some of my most productive yet. Later this fall I’m lecturing in spain, portugal, lithuania, bangkok and australia. I’m a little amazed, that after all these years, the speaking and interview requests, jobs
            and fan mail, keep coming in from all over the world – it’s very humbling.

        <p class="title">
            How would you describe your approach to design?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Experimental, intuitive and personal. I have no formal training, which I’m sure helped a lot as I never learned all the things I’m not supposed to do, I just did what made sense to me. I think my interest in sociology helped lead me initially to editorial
            design, because I was working with real stories, about real people and events, sometimes music.
            <br><br> Since I knew nothing about girds, formulas, schools of thought, etc. I just did what felt right. my starting point was and and is, always to first read the brief, article or whatever it is I’m given. That sends me off in a direction
            design-wise. I try to reinforce visually whats written, spoken or sung. I want the work to connect with people on an emotional level, which is where I feel it’s most effective and lasting.
            <br><br> Different rock stars talked about teachers they had lusted after in school in this beach culture article ‘hot for teacher’. I loved this image of a ‘teacher’ sitting on some books, and the way the type lustfully leans toward her.

        <p class="title">
            Who or what has been the biggest single influence on your approach to design?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Again, probably my lack of formal training, combined with my overall life experience. Growing up primarily in southern california I think gave me a somewhat more experimental, liberal and open minded approach to design and life.
            <br><br> Also my early exposure, through a workshop in switzerland, to the experimental swiss designer hans rudolf lutz was hugely influential with my first job, only months after first discovering the field of graphic design, I was designing
            a skateboard magazine, and basically that became my schooling. I had to figure out everything from spec’ing type , writing instructions on tissue over art boards for printers, how hand held waxers worked, and of course – designing.
            <br><br> Nowadays I usually work on numerous ideas at once for the same topic or project, getting progressively more experimental as I go along. Then I go back and fine tuning the ones that feel the most effective.
        </p>

            <img src="images/david_3.2.jpg" width="33%">
            <img src="images/david_3.3.jpg" width="33%">
        </div>
        <p class="title">
            What type of brief or project do you enjoy working on the most?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Anything I haven’t tried before, any new challenge. I had great 2 month working experience on microsoft for example, and it was fascinating learning experience. But so was working with a new fashion line from vietnam… like most designers I enjoy anything
            that gives me a lot of creative freedom, but when they don’t, it’s just a different type of challenge, it’s like ‘hmmmm, THAT’S a lot of restrictions, how can I still do something that works for them – but that I’m still happy with as a designer?’.
            I also love working with great creative teams, where we all can learn form each other, grow professionally and creatively and push each other.
            <br><br> Having had my own small studio all these years, I’m really at a stage now where I’m looking to join a great creative team, mentor and hopefully motivate some younger designers, while still learning and growing professionally.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What would you say is your strongest skill?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            The ability to speak visually and emotionally to a wide variety of audiences and topics.
            <br><br> I’ve worked for numerous clients, from auto makers, airlines, fashion companies, surf companies, to hi-tech companies and bands like nine inch nails. It’s a very diverse group and I think they come to me because I’m able to speak
            to their specific audiences or demographics, visually.
            <br><br> Astrong concept and or great writing, combined with great design is when the most effective communication occurs, and where the best work happens. As my life experience changes and grows, so does the work. but I feel the basic approach
            of me interpreting subject matter visually, remains similar. just the other day got an e-mail that I felt expressed what I hope my posters do:
            <br><br> ‘dear david, I kind of blame you for taking up graphic design. whilst studying film making in bristol a poster of yours’ caught my eye, announcing that you were giving a lecture on graphic design (never even thought of graphic design
            before that point having been kicked out of art class aged 14). I was so intrigued by the poster I went along (around 1999). from then on I ditched filming-making, finishing the degree and never picked up a video camera again. instead I taught
            myself graphic design. collecting as many copies of ray gun as I could. I’d just like to thank-you for the journey you sent me on, I’ve loved it.’
            <br><br> I’d say that poster was very effective communication. You have to love what you do, you have to enjoy going to work. I say in my talks, find that thing you would do even if you were independently wealthy. That’s a good job. or as
            marshall mcluhan said in our book PROBES ‘if your totally immersed in something, it is no longer work, it’s play or leisure.’
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What are your thoughts on specialization vs generalization?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Generalization tends to make you more employable, especially in small shops, or on very unexciting projects. But also the old saying seems to hold true ‘knowledge in all areas, master of none’. So, I would lean more toward some sort of specialization,
            now more than ever, as anyone can buy the same software and do reasonable, work. Professional and forgettable. I believe strongly the more one can bring personal uniqueness into the work, the better the work becomes. you enjoy it more and
            you also do your best work. it has the most impact if you can put some of yourself into each project. Otherwise we don’t really need designers, anyone can buy the same software and do reasonable work. I think overall designers today have gotten
            lazy, and let the programs and computers make too many decisions for them.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            How do you think online design resources have influenced the graphic design being produced today?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            It’s made everything less experimental, less memorable, less unique and less effective. Its homogenized the work overall and made it easier to forget, with less impact.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What are you currently fascinated by and how is it feeding into your work?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            I’m most fascinated about how social media can work with good design to produce desired and effective results. I still think it’s largely an untapped area. I’m always following world events, news, scanning everything really. Life in all its details continues
            to fascinate me endlessly. I’m watching the various eco movements, politics, new products, and constantly wondering how design can play a bigger, more effective and more important role in all of this.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What are you passionate about besides your work?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Family, surfing, music…
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            Do you have any superstitious beliefs or rules that you live by?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            I try not to tell family or friends about POSSIBLE new work, especially new exciting projects, as I’m afraid I’ll jinx them and not get the job. Over the years it feels like I’ve lost a few projects this way…
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What’s the best piece of advice you have heard?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            My dad once told me that whatever the experience – ‘if you’d either laughed or learned something, it was probably worthwhile’.
            <br><br> Saul bass once told me ‘just keep doing what you do, don’t care or follow the critics.’ – which I thought was great advice and still try to follow to this day.
            <br><br> Years ago an anonymous fax arrived congratulating me on a front page feature story that the NY times had published about me. The fax said that they ‘hoped I was saving money, because once they build you up, they love to tear you down’
            – I probably shoulda taken more notice of that one!
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What’s your personal motto?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Why not?
